# Principled Explanability Architecture (PEA)
## Example Artefacts from the PEA-Guidelines

This repository includes the example provenance traces, provenance templates, provenance queries, and explanation plans produced to support the explanations in the [Credit Card Assessment scenario](https://explain.openprovenance.org/creditscoring/) and the [School Allocation scenario](https://explain.openprovenance.org/school-admission/) as presented in the paper entitled ["Principled Architecture for Explainability and its Guidelines"](https://link.to.be.added/).

The work was supported by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) via the Grants [EP/S027238/1](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/S027238/1) and [EP/S027254/1](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/S027254/1) for the [PLEAD project](https://plead-project.org).
